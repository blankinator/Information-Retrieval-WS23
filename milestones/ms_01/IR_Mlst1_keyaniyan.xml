        <description> What research papers focus on artificial intelligence in healthcare?</description>
        <narrative>
            Relevant documents need to contain information about artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector. This can be information about artificial intelligence that is already being applied or about concepts that could be implemented in the future. Papers that only address artificial intelligence or healthcare by itself should not be included in the search results.
